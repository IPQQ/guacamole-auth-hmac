# guacamole-auth-hmac


## Description
This project is a plugin for [Guacamole](https://guacamole.apache.org/), an HTML5 based
remote desktop solution supporting VNC/RFB, RDP, and SSH.

This plugin is an _authentication provider_ that enables stateless, on-the-fly
configuration of remote desktop connections that are authorized using a
pre-shared key. It is most appropriate for scenarios where you have an existing
user authentication & authorization mechanism.


## Building
guacamole-auth-hmac uses Maven for managing builds. After installing Maven you can build a
suitable jar for deployment with `mvn package`.

The resulting jar file will be placed in `target/guacamole-auth-hmac-<version>.jar`.


## Updating
In order to update this, simply edit `pom.xml` and change the version tag to match the latest Guacamole version that you intend to use.


## Deployment & Configuration
Copy `guacamole-auth-hmac.jar` to `$GUACAMOLE_HOME/extensions/`


### Docker Configuration
Mount a directory containing the compiled JAR to the extensions directory one directory under the directory that is defined as `GUACAMOLE_HOME`. An example `docker-compose.yml` is provided below:

```
version: '3'
services:
  guacd:
        image: guacamole/guacd:1.0.0
        hostname: guacd
        restart: always

    guacamole:
        image: guacamole/guacamole:1.0.0
        hostname: guacamole
        restart: always
        links:
            - guacd
        ports:
            - "8080:8080"
        volumes:
            - ./guacamole-data/config:/config
        depends_on:
            - guacd            
        environment:
            GUACD_HOSTNAME: guacd
            GUACD_PORT: 4822
            GUACAMOLE_HOME: /config
```
The structure of guacamole-data looks like:
```
guacamole-data/
└── config/
    ├── extensions/
    │   └── guacamole-auth-hmac.jar
    ├── keys/
    └── guacamole.properties
```
And guacamole.properties contains:
```
secret-key: <some-secret-key>
timestamp-age-limit: 100000
use-local-privkey: True
key-directory: /config/keys/
```

**NOTE** Be sure to `chmod 755` the extension jar or it will not be loaded!


### guacamole.properties
This extension adds extra config keys to `guacamole.properties`:

| Variable                | Required | Default               | Comments                                                                                                                 |

| `secret-key`            | yes      | None                  | The key that will be used to verify URL signatures. Whatever is generating the signed URLs will need to share this value.|
| `timestamp-age-limit`   | no       | 600000                | A numeric value (in milliseconds) that determines how long a signed request should be valid for. 600000 ms = 10 min      |
| `use-local-privkey`     | no       | False                 | A boolean value to specify whether or not Guacamole should check on the local filesystem for private keys.               |
| `key-directory`         | no       | /etc/guacamole/keys   | A String specifying the location of local private keys. **No trailing '/'.**                                             |

#### Private keys
Since users are authenticated using a web request to the Guacamole server, it is insecure to use pubkey auth by sending the private keys over the web. This feature is enabled by the config parameter `use-local-privkey`. If true, Guacamole will look for the private key `$GUACAMOLE_HOME/keys/<username>/id_rsa_guac` and enable SFTP and use the key for SSH auth. The key and directory must be owned by the user running Guacamole (`tomcat7` in my case).


## Request Signing
Requests must be signed with an HMAC, where the message content is generated from the request parameters as follows:

 1. The parameters `timestamp`, `guac.protocol`, `hostname`, and `port` are concatenated. If `username` and `password` parameters are supplied, they are also concatenated.
 2. Encrypt using SHA256.


## POST
Using the python example, parameters can be POSTed to `/guacamole/api/tokens` to authenticate. The response is then sent as JSON and contains `authToken` which is then used to login: `guacamole/#/client/(connection)?token=(authToken)`

`(connection)` is an encoded string that tells Guacamole to connect the user to a server. It is generated as follows:

1. Remove the first two characters from the ID (I have tried it without shortening the ID, but it did not work).
2. Append `NULLcNullhmac` to the shortened ID.
  - `NULL` represents a `NULL` character (often "\0").
  - `c` stands for connection.
  - `hmac` is the authentication provider.
3. Encode this with base64.

Then, add this to the URL after `guacamole/#/client/` and append the authToken parameter.
